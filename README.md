# Project 4: Machine Learning Fairness

### [Project Description](doc/project4_desc.md)

Term: Fall 2022

+ Project title: Comparison between two algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness

+ Project summary: We compared two algorithms, Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer and Handling Conditional Discrimination, to see which one gives fairer decisions on a given dataset.
	
+ Tomasz constructed a classifier with prejudice remover regularizer model and worked on the presentation slides, wrote his own preprocessing and baseline routine with prejudice remover model, which he went through with Chen to compare results and standardize code with the best output, as well as worked on formatting the slides and the readme descriptions
