# Project 4: Machine Learning Fairness

Project 4 Machine Learning Fairness Algorithms Evaluation

Challenge
Machine Learning Fairness refers to correcting the unfairness for certain groups or individuals in machine learning algorithms' predictions.

=======
+ Project title: Comparison between two algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness

+ Project summary: Compare two algorithms, Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer and Handling Conditional Discrimination, to see which one gives fairer decisions on a given dataset.

explain

what each algorithm does;
how the evaluation was carried out;
and what are the main results.
All developments need to be carried out in group-shared private repo on [https://www.github.com/TZstatsADS/] with clear project management log, taking advantage of GitHub issues.

week 1 [Nov 10]: Introduction and project description.
week 2 [Nov 17]: Introduction to Machine Learning Fairness; Q&A.
week 3 [Dec 1]: Discussion of assigned algorithms.
Evaluation criteria
(7pts) Readabiity and reproducibility of codes
(7pts) Validity of evaluation (well-defined measures of performance; experiment set up)
(6pts) Presentation (report, github and in-class presentation)
(More details will be posted as grading rubrics in courseoworks/canvas)

[wk1] Week 1 is the reading and coding week. Read the papers, understand the algorithms assigned to you and start coding up the algorithms; Also load the data and understand its structure.
[wk2] Based on the outcomes from week 1's reading and brainstorm sessions, continue coding and start evaluation.
[wk2] Week 2 is the evaluation week.
[wk3] By using R/Python Notebook to carry out coding and evaluation, your final report can just be adding explanation and comments to your Notebook.
[wk3] Week 3 is the report writing week. You want to create clear explanation and illustration of the algorithms by using diagrams (can be borrowed from the papers), case examples, summarizing statistcs, and visualizations of performance statistics.
Working together
Setup a GitHub project folder from joining the GitHub classroom link with everyone listed as contributors. Everyone clones the project locally via your GitHub desktop and create a local branch.
Learn to work together is an important learning goal of this course.

Existing R/Python functions that can be part of your implementation.
Unless otherwise instructed, you can use existing R/Python functions as part of your implementation. But, you'll be expected to write the main algorithm by yourself.
